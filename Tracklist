Notes: Maybe I can find the energy to start actually making music, I think it would be a nice hobby.
Also, if for some reason I blow up or my songs become played by actual people, then it could become a career, which is only like, my dream job.
Anyways, chances are I never even start making one song, let alone a whole EP or album, but it's fun to plan!
